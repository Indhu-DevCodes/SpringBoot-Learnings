# Spring - Dependency Injection

### First: What is a “dependency”? 

A **dependency** is **something a class needs to work**.

Example:

* A **Car** needs an **Engine**
* A **Phone** needs a **Battery**
* A **StudentService** needs a **StudentRepository**

So,
👉 *Engine is a dependency of Car*

### Now: What is “Dependency Injection”?

**Dependency Injection = Giving what is needed from outside**

Instead of:

> “I will create what I need”

We say:

> “Someone else will give me what I need”

That **someone else** is **Spring**.

### ❌ Life WITHOUT Dependency Injection (Normal Java)

```java
class Car {
    Engine engine = new Engine(); // Car creates Engine
}
```

### What is happening?

* Car **creates** Engine
* Car **controls** Engine

### Why this is bad?

* Car is **stuck** with this Engine
* If Engine changes → Car must change
* Too many responsibilities

💡 *Car should only DRIVE, not CREATE engines*

### ✅ Life WITH Dependency Injection (Spring Way)

```java
class Car {
    Engine engine;

    Car(Engine engine) {
        this.engine = engine;
    }
}
```

### What is happening?

* Car does **NOT create** Engine
* Engine is **given from outside**
* Car just **uses** it

👉 This is **Dependency Injection**

### 🔁 What Spring Boot Actually Does

Spring Boot:

1. Creates objects (beans)
2. Keeps them ready
3. Gives them to classes when needed

You just say:

```java
@Autowired
Engine engine;
```

Spring says:

> “Okay, I’ll give you an Engine”

### ❓ Why is this IMPORTANT?

### 1️⃣ One Job Per Class

* Car → drive
* Engine → generate power
* Spring → connect them

Clean separation 👍

### 2️⃣ Easy to Change Things

Today:

```java
PetrolEngine
```

Tomorrow:

```java
ElectricEngine
```

Car code stays same ✔

### 3️⃣ Less Confusion, Less Code

You don’t write:

```java
new Engine();
```

Spring handles it 💚

### 🧠 Key Sentence (Remember This)

> **Dependency Injection means a class does not create what it needs; it receives it.**

OR even simpler:

> **“Don’t make it, take it.”**

### ⚡ Tiny Example (Complete Flow)

```java
@Component
class Engine {
}

@Component
class Car {
    @Autowired
    Engine engine;
}
```

What happens?

* Spring creates Engine
* Spring creates Car
* Spring puts Engine inside Car

That’s it. Nothing magical.

---

# Types of DI

### PART 1: First understand the BASIC PROBLEM (before IoC / DI)

### Imagine ONLY normal Java (no Spring)

```java
class Engine {
}

class Car {
    Engine engine = new Engine();
}
```

### What is happening here?

* `Car` **creates** `Engine`
* `Car` **controls** `Engine`
* `Car` has **two jobs**:

  1. Drive
  2. Create engine ❌

This is the **problem**.

### Why is this a problem? (Very important)

Suppose tomorrow:

* You want **ElectricEngine** instead of **PetrolEngine**

Now you must change `Car` code.

👉 **Car is tightly tied to Engine**

### PART 2: The IDEA — IoC (Inversion of Control)

### What is IoC REALLY?

IoC is just a **decision**:

> “My class should NOT create what it needs.”

That’s it. No magic.

---

# What changes with IoC?

### ❌ Old thinking

> “I will create Engine.”

### ✅ New thinking

> “Someone else will create Engine for me.”

That **someone else** = **Spring**

👉 Control is **inverted** (reversed).

### IoC is NOT code

IoC is **who is in charge**.

### PART 3: Now HOW does Spring help? → DI

### DI = Dependency Injection

Plain meaning:

> **Spring gives the needed object to your class.**

So:

* You stop creating
* Spring starts giving

### PART 4: Slowly build a Spring example

### Step 1: Tell Spring which classes it must manage

```java
@Component
class Engine {
}
```

```java
@Component
class Car {
}
```

Now Spring says:

> “Okay, I will create these objects.”

### Step 2: Remove `new`

❌ Don’t do this anymore:

```java
new Engine();
```

### Step 3: Ask Spring to give Engine to Car

Now we reach **DI types**.

### PART 5: Types of Dependency Injection (Very Slowly)

### 🔹 Type 1: Constructor Injection (Start here)

### Code:

```java
@Component
class Car {

    Engine engine;

    Car(Engine engine) {
        this.engine = engine;
    }
}
```

### What is happening internally?

1. Spring creates `Engine`
2. Spring wants to create `Car`
3. Spring sees:

   > “Car needs Engine in constructor”
4. Spring gives Engine
5. Car is created

### Plain meaning:

> “Car CANNOT exist without Engine.”

This is **safe and clean**.

### 🔹 Type 2: Setter Injection (Slower & optional)

### Code:

```java
@Component
class Car {

    Engine engine;

    @Autowired
    void setEngine(Engine engine) {
        this.engine = engine;
    }
}
```

### What happens?

1. Spring creates Car (engine is null)
2. Spring creates Engine
3. Spring calls `setEngine()`
4. Engine is set later

### Plain meaning:

> “Car can exist without Engine, but Engine can be added later.”

### 🔹 Type 3: Field Injection (Shortcut)

### Code:

```java
@Component
class Car {

    @Autowired
    Engine engine;
}
```

### What happens?

1. Spring creates Car
2. Spring puts Engine directly into field

### Why is this bad?

* Hidden dependency
* Hard to test
* Not clear from constructor

### PART 6: Compare all three (VERY CLEAR)

| Question                      | Constructor | Setter         | Field          |
| ----------------------------- | ----------- | -------------- | -------------- |
| When engine is given?         | At creation | After creation | After creation |
| Can Car exist without engine? | ❌ No        | ✅ Yes          | ✅ Yes          |
| Safe?                         | ✅ Yes       | ⚠️ Medium      | ❌ No           |
| Recommended?                  | ✅ Best      | ⚠️ Sometimes   | ❌ Avoid        |

### PART 7: Now connect IoC + DI (MOST IMPORTANT)

### IoC:

> “Spring creates objects, not me.”

### DI:

> “Spring gives needed objects.”

### In one flow:

1. Spring controls creation → **IoC**
2. Spring injects dependencies → **DI**

### PART 8: Final mental picture 🧠

### Without Spring

You:

* Buy parts
* Assemble
* Maintain

### With Spring

Spring:

* Creates
* Assembles
* Gives ready object

You:

* Use it

# FINAL ONE-SENTENCE MEMORY

> **IoC decides WHO creates objects. DI decides HOW objects are given.**

---

#  DI Type to Use - senario

### 1️⃣ What is SETTER Injection? (Reminder)

```java
@Component
class Car {

    private Engine engine;

    @Autowired
    public void setEngine(Engine engine) {
        this.engine = engine;
    }
}
```

Plain meaning:

> “Create the object first, then give the dependency later.”

### 2️⃣ FIELD vs SETTER vs CONSTRUCTOR (Big Picture)

### 🔴 1. Visibility of dependency (MOST IMPORTANT)

### Field Injection ❌

```java
@Component
class Car {
    @Autowired
    Engine engine;
}
```

* You don’t immediately see:

  * Is `Engine` required?
  * Can `Car` work without it?

Hidden dependency ❌

### Setter Injection ⚠️

```java
@Autowired
void setEngine(Engine engine) { }
```

* You can see dependency
* But it looks **optional**

Better than field ✔
Still not perfect ⚠️

### Constructor Injection ✅

```java
Car(Engine engine) { }
```

* Dependency is obvious
* Mandatory

Best ✅

### 🔴 2. Object safety (null problem)

### Field Injection ❌

* Object is created with `engine = null`
* Engine comes later

Risk of `NullPointerException`

### Setter Injection ⚠️

* Same issue
* Engine set later

Still risky

### Constructor Injection ✅

* Object cannot exist without Engine
* No null state

### 🔴 3. Testing without Spring

### Field Injection ❌

Hard to test:

```java
Car car = new Car(); // engine is null
```

### Setter Injection ⚠️

Possible but extra step:

```java
Car car = new Car();
car.setEngine(new Engine());
```

Works, but easy to forget

### Constructor Injection ✅

Easy & clean:

```java
Car car = new Car(new Engine());
```

### 🔴 4. Immutability (simple explanation)

### Field Injection ❌

* Cannot use `final`
* Object can change

### Setter Injection ⚠️

* Can change engine anytime
* Less stable

### Constructor Injection ✅

* `final` possible
* Object is fixed after creation

### 🔴 5. Design intention

| Injection Type | Meaning               |
| -------------- | --------------------- |
| Field          | “Just put it there”   |
| Setter         | “Optional dependency” |
| Constructor    | “Required dependency” |

### 🧠 Real-life analogy 🚗

### Field Injection

You get a car
Someone secretly adds engine later 😬

### Setter Injection

You get a car
You *may* add engine later ⚠️

### Constructor Injection

You get a complete car
Engine already installed ✅

### 🧠 Final comparison table (Very clear)

| Aspect                       | Field | Setter | Constructor |
| ---------------------------- | ----- | ------ | ----------- |
| Dependency visibility        | ❌     | ⚠️     | ✅           |
| Null-safe                    | ❌     | ❌      | ✅           |
| Easy testing                 | ❌     | ⚠️     | ✅           |
| Can mark dependency required | ❌     | ❌      | ✅           |
| Recommended                  | ❌     | ⚠️     | ✅           |

### 🧠 Simple rules to remember

1️⃣ **Required dependency → Constructor Injection**
2️⃣ **Optional dependency → Setter Injection**
3️⃣ **Avoid Field Injection**

### 🧠 One-line memory sentence

> **Constructor = required, Setter = optional, Field = hidden.**

### Inversion of Control

### 🧠 What is IoC? (Inversion of Control)

### Meaning in plain words:

> **IoC means you are NOT in control anymore — someone else is.**

### Simple sentence:

👉 **Control is inverted (reversed).**

### ❌ Normal life (YOU are in control)

You decide:

* When to wake up
* What to cook
* What to buy
* How to do everything

You control everything.

### ✅ IoC life (Someone else is in control)

Hostel / College / Office:

* Food is provided
* Electricity is managed
* Cleaning is handled

You **don’t control** these things anymore.

👉 **Control moved from you to the system**

That is **IoC**.

### In Spring Boot terms (still simple)

### ❌ Without IoC

Your class:

* Creates objects
* Manages objects
* Decides dependencies

```java
Engine engine = new Engine();
```

You are in control.

### ✅ With IoC

Spring:

* Creates objects
* Manages objects
* Decides when and how to give them

You **lose control**.

Spring **gets control**.

👉 This is **Inversion of Control**

### 🧠 Now: What is DI? (Dependency Injection)

### Plain meaning:

> **DI is HOW IoC happens**

DI is just a **method** used to achieve IoC.

### Very simple sentence:

* **IoC = What**
* **DI = How**

### 🎯 Example to connect both

### You need a pen ✍️

### ❌ Without IoC

You:

* Go to shop
* Buy pen
* Bring it

You control everything.

### ✅ With IoC

Office:

* Gives pen to you

You didn’t get it yourself.

👉 Control is inverted (**IoC**)

👉 Pen is given to you (**DI**)

### 🧩 Spring Boot Example (No complexity)

```java
@Component
class Engine {
}

@Component
class Car {
    @Autowired
    Engine engine;
}
```

What happens?

* Spring creates Engine (**IoC**)
* Spring gives Engine to Car (**DI**)

### 🧠 One-line Memory Trick

### 🔹 IoC:

> “I don’t control object creation”

### 🔹 DI:

> “Object is given to me”

## 🧠 Super Simple Summary

| Term         | Plain Meaning                                 |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| **IoC**      | Control is taken from you and given to Spring |
| **DI**       | Spring gives required objects to your class   |
| **Relation** | DI is one way to implement IoC                |

### Final sentence (remember forever ❤️)

> **IoC is the idea. DI is the action.**

---

# How the Object creation happends inside Ioc 

### First: Important Truth 🌱

👉 **You do NOT “create IoC” manually in Spring Boot**

**Spring Boot already has IoC built-in.**
You just **USE it correctly**.

### 🧠 So what does “create IoC” really mean?

It means:

> **Let Spring control object creation instead of you**

That’s it.

### ❌ Wrong way (No IoC)

```java
class Car {
    Engine engine = new Engine(); // YOU are controlling
}
```

Here:

* You created Engine
* You control everything

❌ No IoC

### ✅ Correct way (IoC in Spring Boot)

You do **3 simple things**:

### ✅ STEP 1: Tell Spring “This is an object I want you to manage”

Use `@Component`

```java
@Component
class Engine {
}
```

```java
@Component
class Car {
}
```

This means:

> “Spring, please create and manage this class”

### ✅ STEP 2: Remove `new` keyword

❌ Don’t do this:

```java
new Engine();
```

### ✅ STEP 3: Ask Spring to give dependency (DI)

```java
@Component
class Car {

    @Autowired
    Engine engine;
}
```

That’s it 🎉

### 🔄 What Spring Boot does internally (Simple Flow)

1. Spring starts
2. Finds `@Component` classes
3. Creates objects (beans)
4. Stores them in a container
5. Injects needed objects

👉 **Spring is in control = IoC**

### 🧠 Spring Container (Very Simple Idea)

Think of Spring container as a **big box 📦**

* Inside the box:

  * Engine
  * Car
  * Other objects

When Car says:

> “I need Engine”

Spring takes Engine from box and puts it inside Car.

### 🧩 Minimal Example (Full)

```java
@SpringBootApplication
public class DemoApplication {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(DemoApplication.class, args);
    }
}
```

```java
@Component
class Engine {
}
```

```java
@Component
class Car {

    @Autowired
    Engine engine;
}
```

👉 You did NOTHING extra.
👉 IoC is already working.

### 🧠 One sentence to remember

> **IoC is created when you stop using `new` and let Spring manage objects.**

### ⚡ Alternative way (Using `@Bean`)

```java
@Configuration
class Config {

    @Bean
    Engine engine() {
        return new Engine();
    }
}
```

Spring controls it → IoC ✔

### 🧠 Final Super-Simple Summary

| What you do      | Result                    |
| ---------------- | ------------------------- |
| Use `@Component` | Spring creates object     |
| Remove `new`     | You lose control          |
| Use `@Autowired` | Spring injects dependency |
| Result           | IoC happens               |

# ✅ 3 Ways to Create IoC Container (Spring Framework)

### 1️⃣ **Using XML Configuration**

```java
ApplicationContext context =
    new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("beans.xml");
```

📄 Uses `beans.xml`

🧠 **Remember:**
XML → `ClassPathXmlApplicationContext`

### 2️⃣ **Using Java Configuration (Annotations)**

```java
ApplicationContext context =
    new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext(AppConfig.class);
```

```java
@Configuration
@ComponentScan("com.example")
public class AppConfig {
}
```

🧠 **Remember:**
Java class → `AnnotationConfigApplicationContext`

### 3️⃣ **Using Spring Boot**

```java
SpringApplication.run(MyApplication.class, args);
```

✔️ IoC container is created **automatically**

🧠 **Remember:**
Boot → `SpringApplication.run()`

### 🎯 Interview Answer (Perfect)

> **There are 3 ways to create an IoC container:

1. XML-based configuration
2. Java-based (annotation) configuration
3. Spring Boot, where the container is auto-created using SpringApplication.run().**


### 🧠 Super Easy Memory Trick

```
XML   → XML Context
JAVA  → Annotation Context
BOOT  → Auto Context
```

### ⚠️ Interview Note (Important!)

Strictly speaking:

* **Spring Framework → 2 manual ways (XML + Java)**
* **Spring Boot → automatic (no manual creation)**

👉 But interviewers usually accept **3 ways*

> **In Spring Framework, we manually create the IoC container using ApplicationContext or BeanFactory.
> In Spring Boot, the IoC container is automatically created by SpringApplication.run(), so no manual creation is needed.**

---

# @Bean Vs @Component

### First: What do both do?

👉 **Both `@Component` and `@Bean` create objects that Spring controls.**
That’s the only common point.

### 🧠 Think of Spring as a **factory 🏭**

Spring factory makes objects and keeps them ready.

### 1️⃣ `@Component` (Spring finds it by itself)

### Plain meaning:

> **“Spring, please find this class and create its object automatically.”**

### Example

```java
@Component
class Engine {
}
```

What happens?

* Spring scans the project
* Sees `@Component`
* Creates Engine object
* Keeps it in its box 📦

👉 You did **nothing extra**

### Important point

* Class **must be yours**
* You control the source code

### 2️⃣ `@Bean` (You tell Spring how to create it)

### Plain meaning:

> **“Spring, create this object using MY method.”**

### Example

```java
@Configuration
class Config {

    @Bean
    Engine engine() {
        return new Engine();
    }
}
```

What happens?

* Spring calls this method
* Takes the returned object
* Stores it in container

👉 You **manually explain** how to create it

### 🧠 Real-Life Analogy (Very Easy)

### `@Component`

You say:

> “Spring, cook rice whenever you need.”

Spring knows the recipe and cooks itself 🍚

### `@Bean`

You say:

> “Spring, here is how to cook biryani step by step.”

Spring follows **your instructions** 🍛

### 🧩 When do we use each?

### Use `@Component` when:

* Class is **your own**
* Simple object
* No special setup

✔ Most common
✔ Easy
✔ Clean

### Use `@Bean` when:

* Class is **from external library**
* Needs special setup
* Cannot add `@Component`

Example:

* `DataSource`
* `ObjectMapper`
* `RestTemplate`

### 🧠 Why external classes need `@Bean`?

Because you **cannot edit their source code** to add `@Component`.

So you do:

```java
@Bean
ObjectMapper objectMapper() {
    return new ObjectMapper();
}
```

### 🧠 Key Difference in One Line

| Thing               | `@Component`   | `@Bean`              |
| ------------------- | -------------- | -------------------- |
| Who creates object  | Spring         | You                  |
| How Spring finds it | Class scanning | Method call          |
| Where written       | On class       | Inside config method |
| External classes    | ❌ No           | ✅ Yes                |
| Simplicity          | Very simple    | Slightly manual      |

### 🧠 Memory Trick 🧠

### 👉 `@Component`

**“Spring, you do it.”**

### 👉 `@Bean`

**“Spring, do it THIS way.”**

### 🧠 Final simple sentence

> Use `@Component` when you own the class.
> Use `@Bean` when you don’t own the class or need control.

### 🌱 Simple mental model

* `@Component` / `@Bean` → **Create bean**
* `@Autowired` → **Use bean**

Creation **must happen first**.

---

# @Bean with DI & why external classes inside @Bean?

### ❓ Can we use **external classes** with **DI**?

### ✅ **YES, absolutely**

Spring uses **external classes with DI all the time**.

Examples:

* `DataSource`
* `ObjectMapper`
* `RestTemplate`
* `JdbcTemplate`

👉 DI works **the same** for external classes and our classes.

### ❓ Then why do we need `new` keyword at all?

This is the **core confusion**.
Let’s clear it carefully.

### 🧠 Two different worlds

### 🌍 World 1: Normal Java (no Spring)

If there is **no Spring container**:

```java
ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper(); // must use new
```

Why?

* No one else exists to create the object
* YOU must create it

### 🌍 World 2: Spring Boot (with IoC + DI)

If Spring is managing objects:

```java
@Autowired
ObjectMapper mapper;
```

Why no `new`?

* Spring already created it
* Spring gives it to you

👉 Using `new` would **break IoC**

### 🧩 So how does Spring create external objects?

Using **`@Bean`** or **auto-configuration**.

### Example using `@Bean`

```java
@Configuration
class AppConfig {

    @Bean
    ObjectMapper objectMapper() {
        return new ObjectMapper(); // new is used HERE
    }
}
```

Important:

* `new` is used **only inside config**
* NOT inside business classes

### why does it sometimes NOT work?”

> “If I write `@Autowired ObjectMapper mapper;`

### 🔴 IMPORTANT TRUTH (This is the key)

👉 **`@Autowired` works ONLY if Spring already has an object (bean).**

If Spring **did NOT create** `ObjectMapper`, then:

❌ Spring has nothing to inject
❌ `@Autowired` fails

### ❓ Why Spring does NOT always create ObjectMapper?

Because:

* Spring **does not automatically create every class**
* Spring creates **only beans**
* External classes are **NOT beans by default**

### ❌ What you wrote (why it doesn’t work)

```java
@Autowired
ObjectMapper mapper;
```

You are **asking Spring**:

> “Please give me an ObjectMapper”

Spring replies:

> “Sorry, I don’t have one.”

💥 Result:
`NoSuchBeanDefinitionException`

---

### 🧠 Why Spring has no ObjectMapper?

Because you did NOT tell Spring:

* “Create ObjectMapper”
* “Manage ObjectMapper”

So Spring never used `new ObjectMapper()`.

### ✅ When does `@Autowired ObjectMapper` WORK?

### Case 1: You define it using `@Bean`

```java
@Configuration
class AppConfig {

    @Bean
    ObjectMapper objectMapper() {
        return new ObjectMapper();
    }
}
```

Now Spring has it ✔

```java
@Autowired
ObjectMapper mapper; // works
```

### Case 2: Spring Boot Auto-Configuration

Spring Boot **automatically creates** some beans.

Example:

* `ObjectMapper`
* `DataSource`

So this works **only if auto-config is enabled**.

### 🧠 So where is `new` actually used?

### ✔ Correct place

```java
@Bean
ObjectMapper objectMapper() {
    return new ObjectMapper(); // Spring uses new
}
```

### ❌ Wrong place

```java
class Service {
    ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper(); // breaks IoC
}
```

### 🔄 Why using `new` in service breaks IoC?

Because:

* Spring does NOT know about that object
* No lifecycle management
* No sharing
* No injection

Spring is **out of control** ❌

### 🧠 Why `new` is forbidden in business classes?

Because:

* You bypass Spring
* Spring cannot manage lifecycle
* No DI
* No IoC

❌ Bad:

```java
class Service {
    ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();
}
```

✅ Good:

```java
class Service {
    @Autowired
    ObjectMapper mapper;
}
```

### 🧠 Who should use `new`?

### Only ONE place:

> **Spring configuration code**

Never in:

* Services
* Controllers
* Repositories

### 🧠 Real-life analogy (Very clear)

### ❌ Using `new`

You go to market and buy vegetables yourself 🛒

### ✅ Using DI

Office provides lunch 🍱

### Where is `new` used?

* Kitchen (configuration)
* NOT by employees (services)

### 🧠 Final Simple Rules (Remember these)

### Rule 1

> **If Spring manages it → don’t use `new`**

### Rule 2

> **External class + DI → use `@Bean`**

### Rule 3

> **`new` belongs only in `@Configuration`**

### 🧠 Tiny Full Example

```java
@Configuration
class AppConfig {

    @Bean
    RestTemplate restTemplate() {
        return new RestTemplate(); // new here only
    }
}
```

```java
@Service
class MyService {

    @Autowired
    RestTemplate restTemplate; // DI
}
```

### 🧠 One-line answer (Plain words)

> Yes, we can use external classes with DI. We avoid using `new` in our classes because Spring creates and injects the object for us. The `new` keyword is used only inside configuration so Spring stays in control.

### 🧠 Simple Rule (Very Important)

> **`@Autowired` does not create objects. It only asks for existing ones.**

> `@Autowired` fails because Spring never created the object in the first place.

### 🧠 Final clarity (Keep this in mind forever)

| Situation                  | Result             |
| -------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Spring created bean        | `@Autowired` works |
| Spring did NOT create bean | `@Autowired` fails |
| You used `new`             | Spring is bypassed |

# ❓ Are our Java classes beans by default?

### ❌ **NO**

👉 **Normal Java classes are NOT beans by default.**

Spring does **NOT** automatically manage every class you write.

### 🧠 Simple rule (remember this)

> **A class becomes a Spring bean ONLY if Spring knows about it.**

### ❌ Normal Java class (NOT a bean)

```java
class StudentService {
}
```

This is just:

* A Java class
* Spring ignores it
* You cannot `@Autowired` it

### ✅ How does a class become a bean?

You must **explicitly tell Spring**.

### 🟢 Method 1: `@Component` (Most common)

```java
@Component
class StudentService {
}
```

Now:

* Spring finds it
* Creates object
* Manages it

✔ It is a bean

### 🟢 Method 2: Stereotype annotations

These are also `@Component` internally:

```java
@Service
@Repository
@Controller
@RestController
```

So:

```java
@Service
class StudentService {
}
```

✔ Bean created

### 🟢 Method 3: `@Bean`

```java
@Configuration
class AppConfig {

    @Bean
    StudentService studentService() {
        return new StudentService();
    }
}
```

✔ Bean created

### ❓ Why do we need to “create” beans?

Because:

* Spring cannot guess which classes you want
* Creating everything would waste memory
* You may have helper or utility classes

So **you decide**.

### 🧠 Important clarification (Common confusion)

### ❌ This will NOT work

```java
@Autowired
StudentService service;
```

if `StudentService` has **no annotation**.

### ✅ This WILL work

```java
@Service
class StudentService {
}
```

```java
@Autowired
StudentService service;
```

### 🧠 Real-life analogy

### Your house 🏠

* Only people with **ID cards** can enter

Spring container:

* Only classes marked as beans get entry

Annotations = ID cards 🪪

### 🧠 One-line answer

> Our Java classes are NOT beans by default. A class becomes a bean only when we annotate it or define it using `@Bean`.

### 🧠 Final summary (very clear)

| Class type       | Is it a bean? |
| ---------------- | ------------- |
| Plain Java class | ❌ No          |
| `@Component`     | ✅ Yes         |
| `@Service`       | ✅ Yes         |
| `@Repository`    | ✅ Yes         |
| `@Bean` method   | ✅ Yes         |

# 🌱 Spring Bean Lifecycle 

## ✅ What is Spring Bean Lifecycle?

Spring Bean Lifecycle describes:

> **The steps a bean goes through from creation to destruction inside the Spring IoC container.**

## 🔁 COMPLETE LIFECYCLE FLOW (INTERVIEW MUST)

```
1. Bean Instantiation
2. Dependency Injection
3. Aware Interfaces (optional)
4. BeanPostProcessor (Before Init)
5. Initialization Phase
   ├─ @PostConstruct
   ├─ afterPropertiesSet() (InitializingBean)
   ├─ Custom Init Method
6. BeanPostProcessor (After Init)
7. Bean Ready to Use
8. Destruction Phase
```

## 🔍 STEP-BY-STEP EXPLANATION

## 1️⃣ Bean Instantiation

* Spring creates the bean object
* Uses constructor (default or parameterized)

```java
@Component
class Car {
    public Car() {
        System.out.println("Bean instantiated");
    }
}
```

## 2️⃣ Dependency Injection

* Spring injects dependencies using:

  * Constructor
  * Setter
  * `@Autowired`

```java
@Autowired
Engine engine;
```

📌 **Important:**

> All dependencies are injected **before initialization starts**

## 3️⃣ Aware Interfaces (Optional)

If a bean implements these, Spring injects internal objects:

* `BeanNameAware`
* `BeanFactoryAware`
* `ApplicationContextAware`

👉 Rarely used, but good for interviews.

## 4️⃣ BeanPostProcessor (Before Initialization)

Spring internally calls:

```java
postProcessBeforeInitialization()
```

Used for:

* Validation
* Proxy preparation

### 5️⃣ Initialization Phase ⭐ (VERY IMPORTANT)

Initialization happens **AFTER dependency injection**.

> **Spring provides 3 ways to initialize a bean: @PostConstruct, InitializingBean, and a custom init method defined using configuration.**

Bean is initialized using any of these:

### a) `@PostConstruct` (Recommended)

```java
@PostConstruct
public void init() {
    System.out.println("PostConstruct called");
}
```

### b) `InitializingBean`

```java
public class Car implements InitializingBean {
    @Override
    public void afterPropertiesSet() {
        System.out.println("InitializingBean called");
    }
}
```

### c) **Custom Init Method** (Explicit Configuration) ⭐

### a) Java Config (Spring / Spring Boot)

Defined using `@Bean`

```java
@Configuration
public class AppConfig {

    @Bean(initMethod = "customInit")
    public Car car() {
        return new Car();
    }
}
```

```java
public class Car {
    public void customInit() {
        System.out.println("Custom init called");
    }
}
```

### b) XML Config (Old Style)

```xml
<bean id="car"
      class="com.Car"
      init-method="customInit"/>
```

📌 Points:

* Bean class remains clean
* Method name can be anything
* Works in both Spring & Spring Boot

> ✅ **After DI and after @PostConstruct / InitializingBean, but before bean is ready to use**

## 6️⃣ BeanPostProcessor (After Initialization)

Spring calls:

```java
postProcessAfterInitialization()
```

Used for:

* AOP
* Transaction management
* Security proxies

## 7️⃣ Bean Ready to Use

* Bean is fully created
* Bean is injected wherever required
* Application can use it

## 8️⃣ Destruction Phase ⭐

Occurs when container shuts down.

### a) `@PreDestroy`

```java
@PreDestroy
public void destroy() {
    System.out.println("Cleanup logic");
}
```

### b) `DisposableBean`

```java
destroy()
```

### c) `destroy-method` (XML)

⚠️ Important:

> Destruction callbacks are **NOT called for prototype beans**

## 🧠 EASY MEMORY FLOW (WRITE THIS)

```
Constructor
→ Autowire
→ @PostConstruct
→ Custom Init
→ Ready
→ @PreDestroy
```

## ❓ Spring Boot Impact

❌ Spring Boot does **NOT** change bean lifecycle
✔️ Same lifecycle rules apply

Spring Boot only:

* Creates IoC container automatically
* Reduces configuration

## 🎯 PERFECT INTERVIEW ANSWER

> **Spring Bean Lifecycle consists of instantiation, dependency injection, initialization, and destruction. Initialization includes @PostConstruct, InitializingBean, and custom init methods, which are executed after dependency injection and before the bean is ready for use. Spring Boot follows the same lifecycle.**

---

# ❓ Why Do We Need an Init Method in Spring?

## ✅ Short Answer (Interview)

> **We need an init method to perform initialization logic after all dependencies are injected but before the bean is used.**

### 🔹 What Problem Does Init Method Solve?

### Without Init Method ❌

* Bean is created
* Dependencies may not be ready when constructor runs
* Complex setup cannot be safely done in constructor

### With Init Method ✅

* Bean is **fully created**
* All dependencies are **already injected**
* Safe place to perform setup logic

### 🔍 What Kind of Logic Goes in Init Method?

### Common Real-Time Examples:

1️⃣ **Validate injected dependencies**

```java
@PostConstruct
public void init() {
    if (dataSource == null) {
        throw new IllegalStateException("DataSource not injected");
    }
}
```

2️⃣ **Open resources**

* Database connections
* File streams
* Socket connections

3️⃣ **Load cache / configuration**

```java
@PostConstruct
public void loadCache() {
    cache = loadFromDB();
}
```

4️⃣ **Pre-compute values**

* Encryption keys
* Lookup tables

5️⃣ **Start background tasks**

* Schedulers
* Polling threads

## 🔹 Why NOT Use Constructor for This?

| Constructor                      | Init Method                |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Dependencies may not be injected | All dependencies are ready |
| Object creation only             | Full initialization        |
| Limited logic recommended        | Best for heavy logic       |

🎯 Interview line:

> Constructors should be lightweight; heavy initialization belongs in init methods.

## ❓ Is Init Method Still Needed in Spring Boot?

✅ YES — 100%

⚠️ Important:

> **Spring Boot does NOT remove the need for init methods.**

Boot:

* Creates container automatically
* Follows same lifecycle rules

## ⚠️ Interview Trap

**Q: Can we skip init method?**

✔️ Yes, **if no post-injection logic is required**
❌ No, **if setup depends on injected beans**

## 🎯 Perfect Interview Answer (Say This)

> **Init methods are used to execute initialization logic after dependency injection is completed. They ensure the bean is in a fully usable state before being accessed. Spring Boot follows the same lifecycle.**

## 🧠 Easy Memory Line

```
Constructor → Create object
Init method → Prepare object
```

# 🌱 Spring Bean Scopes 

### ✅ What is a Bean Scope?

A **bean scope** defines: **How many instances of a bean Spring creates and how long they live inside the IoC container.**

👉 🔹 Default Scope - **singleton** - Main Bean Scopes in Spring

## 1️⃣ Singleton (DEFAULT) ⭐

```java
@Component
@Scope("singleton")
public class Car { }
```

### Meaning:

* **One bean instance per IoC container**
* Same object shared everywhere

### Points:

* Created at startup (eager by default)
* Destruction managed by Spring

⚠️ Trap:

> Singleton ≠ one object per JVM
> It is **per container**

---

## 2️⃣ Prototype

```java
@Component
@Scope("prototype")
public class Engine { }
```

### Meaning:

* New object created **every time it is requested**

### Points:

* Created only when requested (lazy)
* **Spring does NOT manage destruction**

⚠️ Trap:

> @PreDestroy is NOT called for prototype beans

## 3️⃣ Request (Web Scope)

```java
@Component
@Scope("request")
public class UserRequestBean { }
```

### Meaning:

* One bean per **HTTP request**

### Points:

* Works only in web applications
* Automatically destroyed after request ends

## 4️⃣ Session (Web Scope)

```java
@Component
@Scope("session")
public class UserSessionBean { }
```

### Meaning:

* One bean per **HTTP session**

### Points:

* Same bean reused for one user session
* Destroyed when session expires

## 5️⃣ Application (Web Scope)

```java
@Component
@Scope("application")
public class AppBean { }
```

### Meaning:

* One bean per **ServletContext**
* Shared across whole application

## 6️⃣ WebSocket (Rare)

```java
@Scope("websocket")
```

* One bean per WebSocket session
* Rarely asked

## 🧠 Easy Memory Table

| Scope       | Instance Created     |
| ----------- | -------------------- |
| singleton   | One per container    |
| prototype   | New per request      |
| request     | One per HTTP request |
| session     | One per HTTP session |
| application | One per app          |

## ❓ Spring Boot Impact

❌ Spring Boot does **NOT** change scopes
✔️ Same scopes apply in Spring Boot

## 🎯 Interview One-Line Answer

> **Bean scope defines the lifecycle and visibility of a bean. The default scope is singleton, and Spring also supports prototype, request, session, and application scopes.**

## ⚠️ Common Interview Traps

* Singleton is **not** per JVM
* Prototype beans are **not destroyed** by Spring
* Request/session scopes work **only in web apps**

## 🧠 One-Line Memory Trick

```
Single → One
Proto → Many
Request → One HTTP
Session → One User
```

# Stereotype Annotations

### ✅ What is **Annotation-Based Configuration** (Stereotype Annotations)?

**Annotation-based configuration** means **using annotations instead of XML** to define and manage Spring beans.

👉 Spring automatically **creates objects (beans)** and **manages them** using annotations.

### 🔹 What are **Stereotype Annotations**?

Stereotype annotations tell Spring:

> **“This class is a Spring bean — manage it in the IoC container.”**

### ⭐ Main Stereotype Annotations (MOST IMPORTANT)

### 1️⃣ `@Component`

👉 **Generic** stereotype
Used when the class doesn’t fit other categories.

```java
@Component
public class Engine {
}
```

### 2️⃣ `@Service`

👉 Used in **Service / Business Logic layer**

```java
@Service
public class PaymentService {
}
```

### 3️⃣ `@Repository`

👉 Used in **DAO / Persistence layer**

```java
@Repository
public class UserRepository {
}
```

✔️ Provides **exception translation** (important interview point)

### 4️⃣ `@Controller`

👉 Used in **Spring MVC** (Web layer)

```java
@Controller
public class UserController {
}
```

### 5️⃣ `@RestController`

👉 Used for **REST APIs**

```java
@RestController
public class UserRestController {
}
```

✔️ Combination of:

```java
@Controller + @ResponseBody
```

### 🔁 How Spring Finds These Beans?

Using **component scanning** 👇

```java
@ComponentScan("com.example")
```

or in Spring Boot:

```java
@SpringBootApplication
```

(Already includes component scanning ✅)

### 🎯 One-Line Interview Answer

> **Annotation-based configuration uses stereotype annotations like @Component, @Service, @Repository, and @Controller to define Spring beans without XML.**

### 🧠 Easy Memory Trick

```
Component  → General
Service    → Business Logic
Repository → Database
Controller → Web
```

> Stereotype annotations like @Component and @Service are part of the Spring Framework. Spring Boot only auto-configures and scans them automatically.
